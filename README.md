# BoolBnB
BoolBnB is the final project of the Boolean Careers Full Stack Web Developer course designed to be able to use all the technologies and methodologies studied during the course.

# Details
BoolBnB is an application to find and manage apartment rentals.
Through BoolBnB, registered users can enter the information of the apartments they want to rent, and they can also decide to pay to sponsor the ads to make them stand out from the non-sponsored ones.
Users interested in an apartment, using the filters of a specific search page, see a list of possible apartments and by clicking on each one they can see a detail page.
Once the desired apartment has been found, the interested user can contact the owner user via message.
